open-plc-utils-0.0.3
---------------

1. Added header VisualStudioNET/include/inttype.h to define print specifier constant PRId64 for Windows systems.

2. Replaced conditional compiler code around print specifiers "lld" and "I64d" and replaced single specifier PRId64 as defined by the system.

3. Renamed man pages ending in .7 with .1 to reflect that fact that they will now be installed man1 instead of man7.

4. Replaced const HOMEPLUG_MTYPE with constant ETH_P_HPAV throughout.


open-plc-utils-0.0.2
---------------

1. Removed references to private vendor-specific MMEs

2. Removed unused archive targets in primary Makefile.

3. Added .gitignore to subdirectories where programs and other objects are compiled.

4. Added conditional __UCLIBC__ compile statement to ARCPPrint.c to account for variable argument definition error during compile; 

5. Added 'ignore' target to cascading Makefiles to re-write local .gitignore files.

6. Corrected email address for Florian Fainelli in module ARPCPrint.

7. Added new HomePlug AV SLAC Protocol MMEs definitions to homeplug.h.

8. Modified makefile 'ignore' target to use tr instead of sed because some sed implementations do not accept '\n'.
