4. Added conditional __UCLIBC__ compile statement to ARCPPrint.c to account for variable argument definition error during compile; 

5. Added 'ignore' target to cascading Makefiles to re-write local .gitignore files.

6. Corrected email address for Florian Fainelli in module ARPCPrint.

7. Added new HomePlug AV SLAC Protocol MMEs definitions to homeplug.h.
