arpc(7)                                        Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                        arpc(7)

NAME
       arpc - Qualcomm Atheros Asynchronous Remote Procedure Call Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       arpc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Print Atheros VS_ARPC messages on stdout. Message display format is determined by the ARPC ARPCID field.

       Messages  having ARPCID=1 have a print format string and variable number of 32-bit arguments. The format string and argu‐
       ment list are passed to ANSI C function vfprintf for output. The number of arguments printed and their interpretation  is
       determined by the format string.

       Messages  having  ARPCID=2  contain raw binary data. The payload is printed as ASCII hexadecimal characters or written as
       raw binary data depending whether stdout is directed to the console or a file. In either case, each payload  is  prefixed
       with the number of bytes in the payload.

       This  program  is  part  of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This is a relatively new program an is still under development. The message display format may  change  from  release  to
       release.

OPTIONS
       -i interface
              The  host ethernet interface to monitor. The named interface, such as eth0, eth1 and so on, must be connected to a
              HomePlug AV ethernet-to-powerline bridge adapter to receive any HomePlug AV  traffic.  The  default  interface  is
              eth1.

       -q     Quiet mode. Suppress the printing of the normal message descriptions on stdout.

       -m     Prefix  ARPC  messages  with a timestamp on output. The timestamp displays the local time as the number of seconds
              and microseconds since the Epoch in floating point format (ie; &quot;1327514344.000872&quot;) so that events can be synchro‐
              nized  later  on.  When the payload is printed in hex or write as raw binary, the length of the seconds portion of
              the time may vary depending on the operating system used to print the timestamp. For exampe, seconds will probably
              be  expressed  using 8 bytes on 64-bit systems but only 4-bytes on 32-bit systems. This is a well known issue with
              the POSIX timval structure. Use option -z to determine exactly how your operating system writes the time stamp.

       -v     Verbose mode. Displays incoming frames in hexadecimal dump format on stdout. This option is independent of  option
              -a which prints VS_ARPC message text on stderr.

       -z     Print  the current time as both hh:mm:ss (ie; &quot;13:17:03&quot;) and seconds.milliseconds (ie; &quot;1327515423.611&quot;) and exit
              the program. This option may be used to verify proper timezone and determine how to map  against  timestamps  from
              other sources.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print  program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARPC MESSAGE STRUCTURE
       All  VS_ARPC  messages  have  the  following general format where RDATALENGTH is the length of RDATA[] and RDATAOFFSET is
       where valid data starts within RDATA[].

          struct __packed vs_arpc_ind
          {
             struct ethernet_std ethernet;
             struct qualcomm_std qualcomm;
             uint16_t RDATALENGTH;
             uint8_t RDATAOFFSET;
             uint8_t RDATA [1];
          }
          * indicate = (struct vs_arpc_ind *)(&amp;message);

       This means that the usable data address is &amp;RDATA[RDATAOFFSET] and usable data length is  RDATALENGTH  -  RDATAOFFSET.  A
       handler can be called as follows to interpret and manipulate RDATA[]:

          ARPCPrint (stdout, &amp;indicate-&gt;RDATA[indicate-&gt;RDATAOFFSET], indicate-&gt;RDATALENGTH - indicate-&gt;RDATAOFFSET);

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example monitors interface eth1 for VS_ARPC.IND messages and prints them on the console. The program con‐
       tinues to monitor until terminated using ctrl-C or terminated by some other means.

          # arpc -i eth1
