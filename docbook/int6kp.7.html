int6kp(7)                                      Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                      int6kp(7)

NAME
       int6kp - Production Device Manager

SYNOPSIS
       int6kp [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Production Device Manager performs basic device operations using the raw Ethernet protocol described in the Qualcomm
       Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual.  It can be used to initialize devices, interrogate  and  control
       them and upgrade them when on-board NVRAM is present.  It supports legacy chipsets INT6000, INT6300 and INT6400.

       This  program  is  the production version of plc and shall not be distributed without the explicit permission of Qualcomm
       Atheros, Ocala FL USA.

OPTIONS
       -a     Read device attributes using VS_OP_ATTRIBUTES. Attributes are short strings  and  integers  that  describe  device
              hardware  and  firmware. They are concatenated to form the output that is similar to option -r but derived differ‐
              ently.

       -B button
              Press the simple connect pushbutton using VS_PB_ENC. The button can be specified by  number  1=JOIN,  2=LEAVE  and
              3=STATUS or string &quot;join&quot;, &quot;leave&quot; or &quot;status&quot;. Use 1 on both devices that are expected to join. Use 2 only on the
              device that is expected to leave the network.

       -C module
              Write (commit) downloaded modules to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. The module can be spedified by  number  1=NVM,  2=PIB
              and  3=BOTH  or  string  &quot;nvm&quot;,  &quot;pib&quot; or &quot;both&quot;. Module 3 is equivalent to option -F which writes the NVM and PIB
              together. You cannot force flash NVRAM using this option. Use option -FF to force flash.

       -d filename
              Read Watchdog Report from the device and write it to the named file in binary format using VS_WD_RPT.  The  report
              file  can  be  sent  to  Qualcomm Atheros for technical analysis. No assumptions are made based on filename and no
              filename convetions are enforced; however, you should use a .log file extension to indicate binary format.

       -D xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the 16 octet Device Access Key (DAK) in hex format. The DAK is used by options -J, -C and -F. It  may  also
              be  specified  as  &quot;key1&quot; or &quot;key2&quot; as explained in the KEYS section. You may omit this option on the command line
              when the device DAK happens to be the same as the program default of &quot;key1&quot;.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr  while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout. This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -E     Erase NVRAM on the local device and reboot using VS_PTS_NVM. This option is similar to option -F or -FF but writes
              all one’s to NVRAM instead of downloaded firmware or paratemeters. Any firmware or parameters that have been down‐
              loaded pending flash will be lost when the device reboots. You must also specify the device DAK using option -D or
              the erase operation will fail without indication. This operation can  only  be  performed  on  the  local  device.
              Attempts  to  erase a remote device are ignored. Some firmware versions do not permit the operation and those that
              do permit it will prevent it on INT6000 devices.

       -f     Read device NVRAM parameters using VS_GET_NVM. An error will be reported when no NVRAM is present. This option can
              be used to determine if NVRAM is large enough to store the runtime firmware and parameter block.

       -F[F]  Write  previously  downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_PTS_NVM. Adding a second F here or another -F anywhere
              on the command line will force-flash a blank or corrupted NVRAM. Firmware loaded from NVRAM will treat force-flash
              as  an  error.  This  option will create new factory settings and erase any existing user settings. Subsequent use
              creates and updates operational settings that can be erased using a factory reset. This option is  executed  after
              all  others on the command line, except for the -R option.  Unlike plc, this option will alter the factory default
              settings to match those of the PIB being written to NVRAM. Flashing with plc does not alter factory settings.

       -g     Read multicast group information discovered while IGMP snooping using VS_MULTICAST_INFO.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses  received  via
              this  host interface are recognized. The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -I     Read  the  device PIB header using VS_RD_MOD and print the firmware major revision number, PIB minor revision num‐
              ber, Device Access Key (DAK), Network Membership Key (NMK), MAC address and other information on stdout.

       -J     Set the Network Membership Key (NMK) on a remote device using VS_SET_KEY. This option is similar to option -K  but
              requires the remote device DAK in addition to NMK and MAC address. The NMK value is defined using option -K unless
              you want to use the default value. The remote DAK is defined using option -D unless you want to  use  the  default
              value.  Programming  remote  device  keys is complicated. It is often easier to connect the device directly to the
              host and use the -K option.

       -K xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the Network Membership Key (NMK) value used by options -M or -J. The symbolic names &quot;key1&quot; and  &quot;key2&quot;  are
              recognized as described in the KEY section.

       -l count
              Define  the number of times that the command will be repeated for each device specified. Normally, you will repeat
              operations on one device only.

       -m     Read network membership information using VS_NW_INFO. This can be used to determine network configuration.

       -M     Set the Network Membership Key (NMK) on the local device using VS_SET_KEY. The NMK value is specified using the -K
              option unless you want to use the default value.

       -n filename
              Read  the  firmware  image  chain  from  device  flash  memory  and write it to the named .nvm file using multiple
              VS_RD_MOD messages. No assumptions are made based on filename and  no  filename  conventions  are  enforced.  This
              option is performed before option -N when both are specified.

       -N filename
              Read  the  named  .nvm  file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD messages. No assumptions are made
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having  invalid  .nvm  format  will  be
              rejected. This option is executed after -n when both are specified.

       -p filename
              Read  user  parameter  block from device flash memory and write it to the named .pib file using multiple VS_RD_MOD
              messages. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename convetions are enforced. This option  is  exe‐
              cuted before option BP when both are specified.

       -P filename
              Read  the  named  .pib  file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD messages. No assumptions are made
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having  invalid  .pib  format  will  be
              rejected. This option is executed after Bp when both are specified.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -Q     Quick  flash.  The program will not wait for a device to reset or the firmware to restart after writing flash mem‐
              ory. This option is desirable with newer firmware that writes flash memory in the background.  It  has  no  effect
              unless used with option -F or -C.

       -r     Read  device firmware and hardware revision using VS_SW_VER. Output is similar to option -a but is derived differ‐
              ently. Example output might look like &quot;eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01  INT6300A0  INT6000-MAC-2-0-2000-1018-20070611-SP1-B
              NOT-UPGRADEABLE&quot;.

       -R     Reset the device using VS_RS_DEV. This option is executed after all others on the same command line.

       -s     Read device SDRAM configuration using VS_RD_CBLOCK.

       -S filename
              Read  the named .cfg file and write it to the device using VS_SET_SDRAM. No assumptions are make based on filename
              and no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having an invalid .cfg file format will be  rejected.  Do
              not  confuse  .cfg files with .config files. See chkcfg and config2cfg for more information on SDRAM configuration
              file formats.

       -t timeout
              Read timeout in milliseconds. Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This  is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response. The default is 50 milliseconds.

       -T     Restore  factory defaults. This permanently erases PIB changes made since the device was last programmed with fac‐
              tory default values. The device will automatically reset and reboot.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets  which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -w seconds
              Defines  the  number  of  seconds  to wait before repeating command line options. This option has no effect unless
              option -l is also specified with a non-zero value.

       -x     Cause the program to exit on the first error instead  of  continuing  with  remaining  iterations,  operations  or
              devices. Normally, the program reports errors and moves on to the next operation, iteration or device depending on
              the command line.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command  line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If  more  than  one  address  is
              specified  then  operations  are  performed  on each device in turn. The default address is local. See DEVICES for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

KEYS
       Encryption keys are long, tedious to type and prone to error. For convenience, the following symbolic names may  be  used
       to  specify  either a Device Access Key or Network Membership Key. They may be entered in place of the full 16-octet key.
       The DAK and NMK will always be different for a given pass phrase.

       key1   This will translate to the HomePlug AV compliant DAK or NMK for pass phrase &quot;HomePlugAV&quot; depending on context.

       key2   This will translate to the HomePlug AV compliant DAK or NMK for pass phrase &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot; depending on context.

       none   Symbolic name for &quot;00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00&quot;.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for  clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for  the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the
              far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL
       USA. Consequently, public information is not available. Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify  message  structure

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  performs  5 operations on one device. It uploads the firmware and PIB from the device and writes
       them to files old.nvm and old.pib, respectively. It reads files new.nvm and new.pib and downloads them  as  new  firmware
       and  PIB,  respectively.  It commits the downloaded firmware and PIB to NVRAM after validating the device DAK. Operations
       are executed in the order just described regardless of the order specified on the command line. If you want  reading  and
       writing to occur in a different order then you must use two or more commands to accomplish tasks in the order you want.

          # int6kp -n old.nvm -p old.pib -N new.nvm -P new.pib -D 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -F 0123456789AB

       It is not neccessary to specify all operations on one command line. The three command lines below do essentially the same
       thing as the command line shown above. Notice that this example uses -C 3, instead of -F, as an alternate  way  to  write
       both  firmware  and  parameters  to NVRAM. Specifying -C 1 or -C nvm will write firmware only. Specifying, -C 2 or -C pib
       will write parameters only. The value 3 is the logical OR of 1 and 2 and could be specified as -C  all.  The  device  DAK
       must appear on the same line as option -C because a valid DAK is required for the commit operation.

          # int6kp -N new.nvm 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # int6kp -P new.pib 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # int6kp -C 3 -D 00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 01:23:45:67:89:28

       The  next  example  downloads file new.nvm and file new.pib and force flashes the local device. Force flashing only works
       with running firmware that has been downloaded and started by the Qualcomm Atheros Bootloader.  See  plcfp  to  download,
       start firmware and perform a force flash in one operation.

          # int6kp -N new.nvm -P new.pib -D 01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF -FF local

       The next two commands are equivalent. They set the NMK on the local device to key1 as descripted in the KEYS section. The
       first command resets the NMK on the local device with -M then specifies the NMK as key1. The second command omits the key
       specification since key1 is the program default NMK. One could, of course, type the full encryption key.

          # int6kp -MK key1
          # int6kp -M

       The  next  command erases the flash memory on the local device using key1 as the device DAK. Assuming that the device DAK
       matches, NVRAM will be erased. Some older versions of Atheros firmware do not support the erase operation.

          # int6kp -ED key1

       The next command is similar to the previous example bu erases only flash memory sector 5  on  the  local  device  because
       option -X was specified. Again, some older versions of Atheros PLC firmware do not support this operation;

          # int6kp -X 5 -D key1
