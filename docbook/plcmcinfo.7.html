plcmcinfo(7)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                   plcmcinfo(7)

NAME
       plcmcinfo - Qualcomm Atheros Panther/Lynx Powerline Device Manager

SYNOPSIS
       plcmcinfo [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  is  part  of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a request_address_type
              The request address type where 0=IPv4, 1=IPv6 and 2fMAC.  The request address type may be  specified  in  decimal,
              hexadecimal  or  binary  or  with  one of the case sensitive strings &quot;IPv4&quot;, &quot;Pv6&quot; or &quot;MAC&quot;.  Prefix a hexadecimal
              value with &quot;0x&quot;.  Prefix a binary value with &quot;0b&quot;.  This option accepted but is not supported on some program ver‐
              sions.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized. The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -t request_type
              The action take during the request such as the number or type of groups to include, whether to clear or  overwrite
              data  and the type of snooping to perform.  The request type may be specified as a decimal, hexadecimal or binary.
              Prefix a hexadecimal value with &quot;0x&quot;.  Prefix a binary value with &quot;0b&quot;.  This option accepted but is not supported
              on some program versions.

       -v     Print  additional  information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command  line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The Ethernet hardware address of some powerline device. More than one address may  be  specified  on  the  command
              line.  If  more  than  one  address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn. The default
              address is local. as explained in the DEVICES section.

KEYS
       Passwords are variable length character strings that end-users can remember. Keys are fixed length binary values  created
       by  encrypting  passwords.  There are two encryption algorithms for HomePlugAV. One for DAKs and the other for NMKs. This
       means that a given password will produce different keys depending on use. This program only deals with keys because  that
       is what powerline devices recognize. The passwords that generated the keys are irrelevant here.

       Encryption  keys  are  tedious  to  type and prone to error. For convenience, symbolic names have been assigned to common
       encryption keys and are recognized by options -D and -K.

       key1   Key  for  encrypted  password  &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;.  This  is  &quot;689F074B8B0275A2710B0B5779AD1630&quot;  for  option   -D   and
              &quot;50D3E4933F855B7040784DF815AA8DB7&quot; for option -K.

       key2   Key  for  encrypted  password  &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.  This  is  &quot;F084B4E8F6069FF1300C9BDB812367FF&quot;  for  option -D and
              &quot;B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D&quot; for option -K.

       none   Always &quot;00000000000000000000000000000000&quot;.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet hardware, or Media Access Control (MAC), addresses. Device addresses  are  12  hexadecimal
       digits (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef) in upper, lower or mixed case. Individual octets may be separated by colons, for clarity,
       but not all octets need to be seperated. For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot;  are  valid
       and equivalent.

       These symbolic addresses are recognized by this program and may be used instead of the actual address value.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the standard Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices, whether local, remote or
              foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA),  00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All  local
              Atheros devices will recognize this address but remote and foreign devices will not. A remote device is any device
              at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
