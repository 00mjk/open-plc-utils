psgen(7)                                       Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                       psgen(7)

NAME
       psgen - Qualcomm Atheros Prescaler Generator

SYNOPSIS
       psgen [options] input_file

DESCRIPTION
       Read  a spectrum analyzer output file and write a set of computed prescaler values to stdout or directly into a PIB file.
       Options permit input file format specification, target chipset selection, power level flattening, gain  adjustment,  car‐
       rier notching and slope manipulation.

       The  spectrum  manipulating options described below are applied in the following order: -F -N -T (in the case of multiple
       tweaks, they are applied in order as shown on the command line).

       This program can also adjust the output power level adjustment PIB setting on the 6400 and the scaled tx gain PIB setting
       on  the  7400.  The  gain  setting  as well as the prescaler values can be inserted directly into the PIB by using the -P
       option, or the user can manually insert the prescalers and gain setting using tools such as psin and setpib.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. See the AMP man page for  an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -d chipset
              The  target  powerline  device  family (ie; chipset). Supported chipsets are ar6400, ar7400, ar7420 and ar7421. At
              this point only ar6400 and ar7400 have been tested.

       -i input_format
              Specifies the input format for the spectrum analyzer file. File format will vary depending in  the  analyser  make
              and model. Currently only output from the Rohde &amp; Schwarz FSL3 is supported (fsl3).

       -F level
              Flatten the output power to level dBm.

       -G gain_adjustment
              Adjust the output power of the AFE by gain_adjustment dB. Valid values depend on the target_device.

       -N notch_set
              Notch the output prescaler using the notch_set specified. Supported notch sets are &quot;usa&quot; and &quot;japan&quot;.

       -P pib_file
              Save prescalers and gain setting to pib file pib_file instead of outputting them to standard output.

       -T sf,ef,sd,ed
              Tweak  the  prescaler  output from sf (start frequency) to ef (end frequency) by sd (start delta) at sf, and by ed
              (end delta) at ef, sloping linearly in dB from sf to ef. The frequencies sf and ef can contain suffixes M for  MHz
              or K/k for KHz. Without any suffix they are assumed to be in Hz.

       -v     Output more verbose information. This option does not yet have any effect.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print  program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       input_file
              The  spectrum  analyzer file. To create the file, program a powerline device with flat prescalers then run a spec‐
              tral analysis and save the output. Spectrum analyzer output format will depend on analyzer make and model so  file
              format may be specified using option -i when executing this program.

EXAMPLES
       The following example outputs the prescalers for an AR6400 device with USA notches and the non-notched areas at -12dBm.

          $ psgen -d ar6400 -N usa -F -12 fsl3_output.txt

       The following example outputs the prescalers for an AR6400 device with USA notches and the non-notched areas at -12dBm to
       the PIB file abc.pib.

          $ psgen -d ar6400 -N usa -F -12 -P abc.pib fsl3_output.txt

       The following example outputs the prescalers for an AR6400 device with no notches, flattens the spectrum to  -12dBm,  and
       adds a slope from 10MHz to 20Mhz from -6dBm at 10MHz to +2dBm at 20MHz. The final result will be a prescaler that is flat
       at -12dBm except for between 10MHz and 20MHz. From 10MHz to 20MHz, the output will start at -18dBm and increase  until  a
       value of -10dBm.

          $ psgen -d ar6400 -F -12 -T 10M,20M,-6,2

       The  following example outputs the prescalers for an AR6400 device with no notches, flattens the spectrume to -12dBm, and
       applies an AFE gain of -4dB. The results are saved in abc.pib.

          $ psgen -d ar6400 -F -12 -G -4 -P abc.pib

       The following example outputs the prescalers for an AR7400 device with USA notches and the non-notched areas at -12dBm to
       the PIB file abc.pib.

          $ psgen -d ar7400 -N usa -F -12 -P abc.pib fsl3_output.txt

       The  following  example outputs the prescalers for an AR6400 device with no notches, flattens the spectrum to -12dBm, and
       adds a slope from 10MHz to 20Mhz from -6dBm at 10MHz to +2dBm at 20MHz. It then applies a tweak from 15MHz  to  20MHz  of
       -3dBm to -3dBm. The second tweak will shift the 15MHz to 20MHz portion of the first tweak down by 3dBm.

          $ psgen -d ar6400 -F -12 -T 10M,20M,-6,2 -T 15M,20M,-3,-3

DISCLAIMER
